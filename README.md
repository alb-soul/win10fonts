Windows 10 fonts for your Linux

Sometimes it's hard to find Windows font in Linux, for example especially when try to add Calibri font to Office on Linux, even when we download it from the internet or (as my experience, install from aur (for Arch Linux or Arch-based distro) like ttf-ms-fonts package, the fonts becomes weird. So this repo include Windows 10 fonts that I've exported directly from my Windows operating system, and the fonts works well.

## Installation :
1. In terminal, clone this repo : git clone https://github.com/alb-soul/win10fonts.git (if clone failed, try to download as zip then extract it)
2. cd win10fonts/Win10fonts/
3. Ensure you have "fonts" folder in ~/.local/share/, it not yet, create it by excute : mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts
4. In current win10fonts directory, copy all files to ~/.local/share/fonts folder : cp * ~/.local/share/fonts
5. You can check then if the fonts was available
